# Restaurant Reviews App: Udacity Project 5
The goal of this project is to take a static restaurant reviews app and revise it to be responsive and accessible. The project consists of three phases:
1. Convert the static app to a responsive design.
2. Implement accessibility features and Aria roles in the HTML.
3. Implement a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets and render visited pages when there is no network access.
